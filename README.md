# JobArchive

Job postings on the Internet contain wonderful data. Unfortunately, the data disappears after the runtime of a job posting. But you can learn a lot from the data of job advertisements.

Digital change will change the way we work together. So it would be great if you could use job postings to see how the demands on applicants are changing. Or in which direction the qualification requirements are going. And not just in the local area, but globally.

Large companies get this data, evaluate it and then offer results via API. But the data itself remains hidden for third-party evaluations.

There are many tools for evaluating data. The know-how on how to use these tools is there. And the infrastructure to store large amounts of data is also there.

We just have to start.
